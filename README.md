# Protocol-Testing
The aim of this project is to create a load testing tool which can be used to measure the throughput of a network by downloading files from an web server.

Download.py is the main file which is used to download files from the server and calculate throughput.
del.py is used to delete all downloaded files from the destination folder each time the program is run
